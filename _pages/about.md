<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

 I am currently an assistant researcher\/professor at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2012, I was graduated from Wuhan Institute of Technology. And then I obtained the M.E. degree from Capital Normal University, Beijing, China, in 2015, advised by Prof. <a href='https://iec.cnu.edu.cn/szdw/bssds/bssds1/105294.htm'>Zhiping Shi</a>. In 2020, I received the Ph.D. degree from the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Prof. <a href='http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496647.html'>Shuqiang Jiang</a>.

 My research interests include embodied AI, large-scale image classification, vision and language understanding, and Embodied AI. I have been serving/served as a reviewer of IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TIP, IEEE TMM, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TBD, and ACM TOMM. I also have been serving/served as a PC member of leading conferences in vision, multimedia, and AI, such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM MM, IJCAI, and AAAI.
